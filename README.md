# EasyKeep *v-3.4.2*

---

**EasyKeep** Started out to be an app to help my mom with her house keeping business. After doing that I wanted
to help others with there small business.

**EasyKeep** will help you keep track of all your:

+ customers
+ accounts
+ services provided
+ invoices
+ payments received

**Customers** will be invited to view there:

+ account information
+ service history
+ invoices
+ payments

Have someone you want to over see your accounts? No problem. Invite them to become an admin over your accounts.
Different user roles have different role permissions. An Owner of course has total control. An Admin has total control
over the accounts. A Customer can only view their own account information and they can also change there contact
information so you can always have current information.

This app is geared for small businesses with no overhead and provides a service such as:

+ house keeping
+ interior design
+ baby sitting
+ lawn care
+ ect.
