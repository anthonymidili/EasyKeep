      Tell EasyKeep what type of service you provide. That way when you create an invoice for your
      customers, instead of just saying "Services" over the services listed on the invoice, it will say
      "Cleaning Services" or "Lawn Care Services". Keep in mind that the word "Services" will be added after
      the type of service you provide.
